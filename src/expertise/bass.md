The heartbeat of all music...the bass guitar! Have you ever wondered what makes a song so thick, so deep and so moving? It’s all about that bass.

Though a regular bass has only 4 strings and is seemingly a bit easier to play than a 6 -string guitar, it’s equally beautiful and complex.

When you are playing the bass guitar, you are always following the drummer and that “kick drum!” Along with drums the bass guitar is the heart beat of most songs...in any style, genre or ethnicity!
